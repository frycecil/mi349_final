                    <p>One of the big focuses of this study was on the dialogue, and expressing emotion through body language and movement. I chose a short voice line from Hercules, and without following what the animator for Disney did in the 2D film, I tried to make 'Megara' move how I thought she would in a 3D space. It was fun to storyboard ideas on certain poses and facial expressions to implement into a more theatrical piece.</p>

                    <p>To work on a more game animation focused piece, I went with the classic 3 -hit-combo (which after discussion among peers I have noticed it is more like a 4-hit, based of the reference I used I considered it 1 motion) This piece was challenging as getting the speed form pose to pose was difficult, however the project taught me some tips for workflow and helped me become quicker with decision making </p>

                    <p>Instead of the more typical practices such as walk cycles and general body mechanics, I wanted to have a fun personal project to help me practice converting reference into animation. My inspiration derives from many users on social media who do similar things to this video, and take trending dances and turn it into animation! It was a fun exercise and made me self motivated to finish a project I wanted to work on instead of being assigned a task.</p>

                    <p>This piece was one of my earlier works, where I was focusing on how to constrain and parent the weapon to work alongside the model. It was helpful to get a sense of when to constrain and when to turn it off, and allowed me to experiment with body mechanics even more. This project became the basis for the 3-hit-combo, basically a practice run.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to work a lot more with weight and timing and of course more body mechanics, and was suggested by my mentor to create a scene where a character goes through obstacles and hops around. I have watched a lot of other artists do their own parkour scenes and wanted to try it out for myself. The swinging on the bar proved difficult, but after talking with my peers I am excited to try a different approach the next time I come across a motion such as that!</p>

                    <p>For any game animation position, it is important to work through cycles and get a handle on how to loop animations in a convincing fashion. While this piece is rather simple, it taught me so much about what a repeating cycle looks like and what workflow is best to achieve it. I plan to continue practicing walk cycles and pushing the animations to have more personality, but overall I am happy with how this turned out!</p>
